The app provides visual representations of various economic indicators, including:\n\n- S&P 500\n- Dow Jones Industrial Average\n- NASDAQ\n- Unemployment Rate\n- Inflation Rate\n\nThe app is a static web page that runs entirely in your web browser using [shinylive](https://posit-dev.github.io/r-shinylive/), so it can take a bit to load. \n\nThe app is best viewed in landscape mode on a mobile device.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Multiple Economic Indicators**: Compare performance using S&P 500, Dow Jones, NASDAQ, Unemployment Rate, and Inflation Rate.\n- **Flexible Reference Points**: Choose between \"Inauguration Day\" or \"Day Before Election\" as your reference point.\n- **Party Filtering**: Filter presidents by political party.\n- **Customizable Time Period**: Adjust the number of days to display for comparison.\n- **Data Export**: Download the plot or raw data for your own analysis\n\n## How It Works\n\nHistorical economic data is downloaded daily and stored in the app [GitHub repository](https://github.com/jhelvy/potus-econ-scorecard). The app loads this data and calculates performance metrics relative to your chosen reference date. For market indices (S&P 500, Dow Jones, NASDAQ), performance is shown as percent change from the reference date. For economic indicators (Unemployment Rate, Inflation Rate), absolute values are displayed.\n\n## Data Sources\n\n- Market data (S&P 500, Dow Jones, NASDAQ) is sourced from Yahoo Finance\n- Economic indicators are sourced from FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data)\n\n## Technology\n\nThis application is built using:\n\n- [R Shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/) for the interactive web application.\n- [shinylive](https://posit-dev.github.io/r-shinylive/) for browser-based execution without a server.\n- [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) for website publishing.\n- [plotly](https://plotly.com/r/) for interactive visualizations.\n\n## Local Deployment\n\nTo run the app locally:\n\n1. Clone the repository:\n\n   ```bash\n   git clone https://github.com/jhelvy/potus-econ-scorecard.git\n   cd potus-econ-scorecard\n   ```\n\n2. Open the project in RStudio or run from the R console:\n   ```r\n   library(shiny)\n   runApp()\n   ```\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome!
