This application allows you to compare different economic indicators under different US presidents.

## Features

- **Multiple Economic Indicators**: Compare performance using S&P 500, Dow Jones, NASDAQ, Unemployment Rate, and Inflation Rate.
- **Flexible Reference Points**: Choose between "Inauguration Day" or "Day Before Election" as your reference point.
- **Party Filtering**: Filter presidents by political party.
- **Customizable Time Period**: Adjust the number of days to display for comparison.

## How It Works

Historical economic data is downloaded daily and stored in the app [GitHub repository](https://github.com/jhelvy/potus-econ-scorecard). The app loads this data and calculates performance metrics relative to your chosen reference date. For market indices (S&P 500, Dow Jones, NASDAQ), performance is shown as percent change from the reference date. For economic indicators (Unemployment Rate, Inflation Rate), absolute values are displayed.

## Data Sources

- Market data (S&P 500, Dow Jones, NASDAQ) is sourced from Yahoo Finance
- Economic indicators are sourced from FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data)
