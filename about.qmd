This application allows you to compare the economic performance under different US presidents using various economic indicators.

## Features

- **Multiple Economic Indicators**: Compare performance using S&P 500, Dow Jones, NASDAQ, Unemployment Rate, and Inflation Rate.
- **Flexible Reference Points**: Choose between Inauguration Day or Day Before Election as your reference point.
- **Party Filtering**: Filter presidents by political party.
- **Customizable Time Period**: Adjust the number of days to display for comparison.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Hover over data points for detailed information and download plots or data for further analysis.

## How It Works

The application fetches historical economic data and calculates performance metrics relative to your chosen reference date. For market indices (S&P 500, Dow Jones, NASDAQ), performance is shown as percent change from the reference date. For economic indicators (Unemployment Rate, Inflation Rate), absolute values are displayed.

## Data Sources
